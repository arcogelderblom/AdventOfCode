## Input files
As per request by Eric Wastl the actual input files that I've got for my entry are hidden inside of a submodule that points to a private repository. All my solutions however should be able to run all possible inputs, so grab yours and try it out!

## How to run
There are 2 scripts included in this repository. First you need to build the generic library. This can be done by using the following command:
```
./build_genericlib.sh
```
Afterwards you can run any day that is available with a solution.
```
./run_aoc_day.sh <day> <year>
```
Example for running day 1 of 2023: ```./run_aoc_day.sh Day01 2023```
If you would like to run all days of a given year you can do so by using the script for that.
```
./run_aoc_year.sh <year>
```
Example for running all days of 2021: ```./run_aoc_year.sh 2021```
