## Input files
As per request by Eric Wastl the actual input files that I've got for my entry are hidden inside of a submodule that points to a private repository. All my solutions however should be able to run all possible possible inputs, so grab yours and try it out!

## How to run
There are 2 scripts included in this repository. First you need to build the generic library.
```./build_genericlib.sh```
Afterwards you can run any day that is available with a solution.
```./run_aoc_day.sh <day> <year>```
For example: ```./run_aoc_day.sh Day01 2023```

## GitHub workflow
The GitHub workflow runs automatically to build and run the code. Current OSs that are included in the GitHub workflow are Ubuntu (`ubuntu-latest`) and macOS (`macos-latest`)
